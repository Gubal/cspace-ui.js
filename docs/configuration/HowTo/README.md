# Configuration How-To

A guide to common UI configuration tasks, including examples.

To use this documentation, first [create an HTML page containing the UI](../../installation), or locate the page installed in your CollectionSpace server (for example, in `/usr/local/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.64/webapps/cspace#core/index.html` for a standard installation of the core profile).

Each of the following how-to guides shows configuration settings that may be added to the HTML page to customize the CollectionSpace UI.
