# Record Type Configuration

In order to view and edit CollectionSpace records, the UI must be configured with information about each type of record in the system. For each record type, this information includes:

- The names and data types of the fields, and their logical organization (the schema).
- How to display each field to the user, and the kinds of user interactions that should be allowed (the view).
- How to visually organize (lay out) the fields for viewing and editing (the form templates).
- How to display the record in a search result table (the columns).

## Example

Record types are configured by the `recordTypes` property of the [cspace-ui configuration](../configuration) object, as in the following example:

```JavaScript
```
