# Developer Documentation

This documentation is intended for developers who wish to modify CollectionSpace UI (cspace-ui) source code, or implement plugins to extend the functionality of the application.

The cspace-ui project is one of several related CollectionSpace JavaScript projects. The projects are designed to work together, but may also be used independently. All of the projects have similar structures, and use similar tools and libraries.
